Hello Everyone...This is Riddhiman
In this project I am trying out some advanced features of django and trying to integrate a ReactJS front end and django backend
What I have achieved till now:
My task was to make an email schedular during a hackathon, 
could achieve the preliminaries of it using simple smtplib and apschedular but many flaws were there
This is a conscious effort to improve this project
 ------------Here I am trying to use REST framework, User Models, Self built pwd verification, file post handling,
 -------------Sending files as mails, self implemented user registration without using django facilities,
 -----------use of hashing libraries to make credential storage safer, HTTPS connections
 ********What I am trying to achieve now(file handling at front and backend, hosting,sending files 
 and images as responses for better user interaction, etc.)
